All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at droidcon Vienna are required to agree with the following code of conduct.

##### The Quick Version

droidcon Vienna is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

##### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/ uniforms/ costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, droidcon Vienna organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security, local law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance and we are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

Organizer team members are identified by the red highlighted badges.
