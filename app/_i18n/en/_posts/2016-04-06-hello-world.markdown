It started in summer 2015 when we heard about the opportunity to bring [droidcon](http://droidcon.com) to Vienna. From the very beginning we have been extremely excited about this opportunity to bring such a high-level community conference around Android Development to Vienna!

There is a lot of work necessary in the background: paper work, signing of contracts, visiting possible locations, planning for a date, compiling a team â€“ but still we wanted to tease the coming event and started to spread the news about this opportunity at DevFest Vienna 2015.

Now we are ready to tell everybody: droidcon Vienna is coming!

And you should not miss this event:

* **Attendance**: we are expecting over 200 attendees
* **Topic**: more than 20 hours all about Android development 
* **Date**: 16 - 17 September 2016, including a half-day barcamp
* **Venue**: Technikum Wien - the University of Applied Science in Vienna
* **Speakers**: expect outstanding speakers from everywhere
