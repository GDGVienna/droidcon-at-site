Our new website is live, based on [Project Zeppelin](https://github.com/gdg-x/zeppelin-grunt) by [GDG Lviv(http://lviv.gdg.org.ua/).
We are now ready to present a (draft) schedule, the initial list of speakers, and some touristic information about Vienna.

#### Initial Set of Speakers

Our first round of speakers is online. We have selected even more and will update this information soon.
They come from international companies like Google and Twitter as well as from innovative local companies like PSPDFKit and [shpock](https://www.shpock.com/). Have a look at the speaker line up on [droidcon.at/speakers](https://droidcon.at/speakers/), and expect some additional faces there soon!

_Our call for papers is currently open. Interested in adding your talk? Head over to [cfp.gdg-vienna.at](https://cfp.gdg-vienna.at/) and submit your proposal!_
