### Registration is open
Interested in joining droidcon Vienna 2016? The [registration](https://droidconvie-2016.eventbrite.com) has just started, and for the first ten days you can make use of a Super Early Bird discount - 40% off the regular price.

This is for those who trust us most (thank you!) that we will make an awesome conference. We made all our tickets refundable till the last week before the conference - because we know you will love attending it.

Here the link for the registration: [droidconvie-2016.eventbrite.com](https://droidconvie-2016.eventbrite.com)

And we are looking for volunteers - please see [droidcon.at/volunteer-ticket](https://droidcon.at/volunteer-ticket) for more details.

### Sessions
We started looking through the talk proposals received so far. Topics suggested include: _Dagger 2 and MVP; MVVM Pattern; Hack your own Android ROM; Material Design for Android Wear; #PERFMATTERS for Android; Firebase and Android; Nearby API_ - and this is just a small selection!

The Call for Speakers is still open till 15 May. Spread the word and submit your proposal on [droidcon.at/#call](https://droidcon.at/#call)!

### Google I/O
[Google I/O](https://google.com/io) starts next week and we expect a lot of announcements relevant for Android Developers. Therefor we will also re-open the call before summer so that the latest news can be reflected in the sessions for droidcon Vienna.

The best way to join Google I/O - except for being on-site - is joining an I/O Extended event nearby. There is also one in Vienna - [I/O Extended 2016 Vienna](http://www.meetup.com/GDG-Vienna/events/229686957/)
