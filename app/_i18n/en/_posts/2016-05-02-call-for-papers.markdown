### Call for Papers
Our Call for Papers is open till 15 May, and we have already received more than twenty proposals from highly qualified Android developers and developer advocates.

If you know someone who should definitely speak at droidcon Vienna please send them the link to our call:
[droidcon.at/#call](https://droidcon.at/#call)

### Tickets
We will start with the ticket sale next week. And for the first couple of days you can join the conference with a Super Early Bird discount - 40% off the regular price. You should not miss this opportunity!

Tickets will be available through our website droidcon.at starting 9 May 2016.

### Sponsors
Without sponsoring a conference like droidcon Vienna would not be possible, and we are proud to welcome our first Silver sponsor [shpock - the boot sale app](https://www.shpock.com/).
