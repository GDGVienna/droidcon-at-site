  description: "MotionLayout is a new layout based on ConstraintLayout. With MotionLayout, animations and transitions finally are becoming easier to implement. No more disappointing your designer because it would take too long to build this awesome animation! In this talk, you will learn how to use MotionLayout starting with building a simple animation that will replace an existing CollapsingToolbarLayout. As we move on, you will learn about KeyFrames, KeyCycles and other awesome features of MotionLayout, helping you build those fancy animations your designer always wanted you to build. To help make your animations as awesome as possible, you will also learn how to make them follow the Material Design Guidelines using interpolation, animation choreography and fine-grained details about motion. You will leave this talk ready to use MotionLayout and create awesome animations - your designer will be stunned!"

When it comes to Android (app/library/IOT) development, the first thing that comes to mind is to install Android Studio and get going from there. However, it has not been a smooth road as expected for me. In my own experience, I talk about my love-hate relationship with Android Studio. I try to cover what Android Studio gets right and what it doesn't. The talk focuses on how to be embrace performance when Android Studio is the bottleneck in the workflow (slow build times and reduced productivity), how switching to a terminal and various tools that exist in the ecosystem can give Android developers the much-needed speed boost and in-depth view in their development workflow. By the end of this talk, you would have embraces a workflow that allows for increased productivity and faster development."

We established with designers a UIKit, a pattern library, implemented as an Android library and inspired from Atomic Design, defining every UI component of the app. During the presentation, we will dive in the UIKit to see how components are defined and organized, integrated in the app with global architecture, and the implications on the design and development process in our team."

In this talk, I will explore an Android app that list version of Android. For each version we will discover a new example, starting with basic modification of a constraint. Then adding KeyFrame with position, scale and rotation. Next playing with customs attributes to change the image color saturation. At the end we will explore connection with Coordinator Layout, View Pager, Drawer and SeekBar. At the end, you should know how to use and what are the capabilities of MotionLayout. Should you use it in your application?"

Although we want all prospective users to have the ability to install our app, this may not be possible due to limitations in storage and network connection, especially in emerging markets. What if we can deliver new features selectively post-installation, reducing the initial app size, and allowing us to target a wider audience?"

From IO 2018 with the announcement of project Nitrogen, Google'd like to 'nitrogenize' our tests creating a single entry point and solve all issues we had in the past. With October release of Robolectric 4.0 and androidx.test 1.0.0, both testing environments are converging on a set of common test APIs. Robolectric now supports the AndroidJUnit4 test runner, ActivityTestRule, and Espresso for interacting with UI components. Let's see togheter how to organise different levels of our 'test pyramid', with a focus to the last news/releases in order ot be ready for the Nitrogen release."

Maybe you have been wanting to have a look at it but haven't or you already have given it a go but got scared away with all the FP jargon (We are looking at you Monads). In this talk, we will look at how to get started with FP using Kotlin with the existing knowledge you have and look at how we can start moving towards FP by making a few changes(trust me, no talking about the jargon or 3rd party libraries) in your day to day activities. I will also talk about my journey about going from OOP to FP. We will look at some of the mistakes I did and some of the approaches I took while learning FP. We will also create a simple structured approach to start learning/implementing FP in your existing code so that you can learn by doing. At the end of the talk we will look at why a library like Arrow-KT can be useful once you have mastered the basics of FP and also how to approach Arrow-KT for your FP needs."

  title: "Refactoring Risky Code"
  description: "How do you refactor bluetooth code on Android with zero test coverage? When touching such code you have to test it with real phones and bluetooth devices to ensure you are not breaking anything. Thus changes come with a high risk of introducing new bugs. At mySugr we spent quite some time refactoring our bluetooth code, so that we can write plain Kotlin unit tests for it and easily add new functionality. You are going to see how we achieved the refactoring with almost zero bugs and a minimal manual testing effort. This talk doesn’t deal with the details of bluetooth on Android. Instead, we will discuss the strategies and methods we used and how it can be applied to any refactoring of dangerous code. Finally, I’m going to show you that you can even write tests for bluetooth code - there is no excuse not to write tests."

  description: "A while back, Google introduced Instant Apps: small, demo versions of your app that users can quickly download and try out. As you can imagine, this has the possibility to change how users download apps, and adopters can see large increases in Play Store conversions. However, it comes at a cost: for games, there's a size limit of 10 MB, and for regular apps, the limit is 4MB. That’s tiny; you can easily cross that line with dependencies alone. In this talk, we’ll discuss the technical tools available to you to shrink your apps, and talk about some of our hard learned lessons on how to come in under the line."

  description: "As your application, product and team rapidly develops and scales, you will undoubtedly have inconsistent UI components. It’s easy for developers and designers to create new elements that differ in really small specifications. This not only creates a bad branding experience, but also the feeling that there are several apps and styles inside the same app. In this talk, we will show you some design system fundamentals, how to properly map them to the Android framework and how you can build re-usable components on top of it. We will also tackle what are the biggest problems migrating to a design system from nothing, and how you should approach it. By the end of the talk, we just hope that you go and meet your designer and start developing your design system."

  description: "Do APK or app size matters? Yes, it does. The user thinks about the app size before downloading an app. The user thinks about the data also over which he will be downloading that app. He or she even think about how much space will it take on his or her device. How can we reduce the size of the app? What if we provide very basic functionality and let the user decide whether he wants the advanced or additional functionality or not. What if he or she can download only the features he needs on demand and keep the app compact. What if he can download only his native language in which wants the app and can skip rest all the languages. Google new feature of dynamic delivery enables us to deliver the features on demand. This helps us to reduce the size of APK and even enables the user to choose what features he needs. From a developers perspective, this is very easy to implement and maintain. What is actually a dynamic delivery? How can we reduce the APK size with it? How it can help a user? How to implement it in Android? How difficult is it to implement in the existing code base? How will it look to the user in the app? Well, let’s get all these questions answered in the talk along with a demo."

  description: "While most developers are elated when Android Studio compiles their code without any “hiccups”, there is a lot going on when that compiled code runs on Android OS. Android mostly takes care of runtime, but it’s always nice to know what’s happening backstage. How code executes at runtime is a completely different story in case of Android. The .dex format has been here for years and everyone is accustomed to it. But there are a lot of complexities going on once the .dex reaches your device. This talk will focussed on analyzing on what happens after your code in Kotlin/Java is compiled, packaged and run on an actual device. We will take a deep dive into .dex format as well as see how runtime has evolved since Android 1.0 and taken a great leap with Android 5.0 and above. In the process, we will also learn how to write runtime efficient code."

  description: "In the past, engineering teams typically split “frontend” and “backend” responsibilities. As an Android developer, you almost certainly slotted into the “frontend” category, with no responsibility on the backend. And if you do want to work on the backend for an app, it can be taxing to learn new tools and languages, while being responsible for managing and scaling a server farm. Today, with “serverless” backends becoming popular, server management and scaling is being fully automated, and you can use many of the same tools and languages you use for Android development. Do you want to write Kotlin everywhere? There’s a solution for you! Join this talk to survey some serverless options provided by Google, see some demos, and figure out which options are right for you."
