  description: "In today's workplaces, there are still huge issues with diversity and inclusivity. Whilst you may not notice it in your workplace, underrepresented groups are faced with difficulties and feelings that those with privilege are likely to have never encountered. But this doesn't, and shouldn't, have to be the way - being an ally allows us to amplify the voices of the underrepresented and make change happen."

  description: "Fingerprint authentication is becoming increasingly popular in apps these days. In the past, you may have used the FingerPrintManager class to implement it in your app. But with this approach, the responsibility of implementing the UI was all on you. Thankfully, with the release of Android P, there’s a new, better way of doing it using the Fingerprint Dialog API and delivering a better experience to your users. In this talk, you will learn all about the new Fingerprint Dialog API. We will look at the rationale behind this change, how to implement the new APIs in an existing application, and how to incorporate them when starting from scratch. We will also look at how to handle results for the authentication and close out with tips for failing gracefully. You don’t want to miss out on this powerful new API!"

Mainstream media continues to run stories of Cambridge Analytica's impact on democratic elections, and with the recent introduction of GDPR, data protection continues to be a hot topic.<br>This talk will focus on security features available from Google Play Services and Google's SafetyNet APIs. We will see how they allow developers to verify the trustworthiness of the devices their apps run on, as well as examples of how to implement them to improve your app’s security.<br>Next, we will share first hand experience of hardening an Android app that handles medical & health information. We will see where patient data had the potential to be leaked to 3rd parties and the measures taken to resolve this.<br>In this current climate of heightened user awareness we need to show that we can protect the users of our products, after this session you will be better able to do just that."

  title: "What the Hype?"
  description: "During the development process, we tend to decide on a technology based on the current amount of hype on the internet, in the media, from friends and colleagues. This often leads to a catastrophic result. If you do not base your decision on analytical data, the chosen technology could potentially be unusable for your project or even deprecated. You're shooting yourself in the foot before development has even started. In this talk, we'll take a closer look into what hype-driven development is, examine some of the greatest hypes in Android development in the last couple of years, and provide guidelines for selecting technology based on facts instead of emotions."

  description: "One of the most popular Java books is 'Effective Java' from Joshua Bloch, which describes how to avoid common mistakes, how to deal with Java's weaknesses, and how best practices for the language look like. When Jetbrains started to create a 'better Java' with Kotlin, a lot of ideas about how to make a better language came from the information of 'Effective Java' and lots of design decisions are based on the book. In this talk the audience will learn how the book influenced the language design and the compiler of Kotlin and in what way the book is deeply ingrained into the language."

Started as a strictly volunteer effort, we went through various toolchain changes, multiple overhauls of the UI but are now at a state where we have most features ready 'under the hood' (also thanks to LibreOfficeKit) and all that is left is adding some buttons and other controls for editing, right? The presentation will cover how we hook up LibreOffice's build system to android's ndk environment, the struggle with change and the current state of the port."

  title: "Dear Kotliners, Java developers are humans too"
  description: "Ever since Google made the announcement, Pro-Kotlin developers have been having the times of their life. We see a lot of developers using their command of the language to showcase their works and skills. While we have to appreciate Kotlin for bringing a new life to the dull and verbose Android development, it has also created an imaginary wall between the two factions of developers - One who worships Kotlin and the ones who wants to. Believe me, when I say, most of us want to learn and adopt Kotlin. But a few things are standing between the later of the two factions and their end goal. It is not easy for many to find time to learn Kotlin and it is definitely not possible if your company wants to push features out and not spend time rewriting the code that is working in Java or experiment with something new when the old one works perfectly fine! But as a developer, when you see a lot of libraries coming up with solutions in Kotlin, it is not easy for those poor souls to catch up. It breaks their heart to know that they are not able to catch up with the rest of the world. Sometimes, when searching for a library to reduce their work, what do they see? All examples in Kotlin - Beautifully written with Lambdas and higher-order functions. Amazingly structured and optimized with coroutines. So what do the Java developers do? They move away. Did the developers intend them to not use their library? No. They just didn't want to think about Java when they have moved to the all-mightly Kotlin. But for the foreseeable future, Java developers and Kotlin developers need to exist side-by-side until there is a definite transition from Java to Kotlin. This talk is for those Kotlin developers who came from humble Java beginnings to remind them of the sufferings Java developers have to undergo and that they are humans too."

  description: "<em>Developer's chores will be an infinite loop of WRITE, TEST and COMPILE code</em>. It's not the case for most Android developers, we do have repetitive boring tasks to be done in every project. But Gradle plugins can help us package these uninspiring tasks as reusable Gradle tasks, which can be used across projects. In this talk, I aim to break Gradle magic by revealing what goes on behind the scene. I will go over basics of Android Gradle plugin development by creating Gradle tasks and extensions for syncing TODO comments to the cloud. I will then talk about Android Gradle tool APIs for creating plugins that inject/generate resources and classes. After attending this talk, you will get familiar with building blocks of the Gradle plugin to get started with your plugin development and quash those uninspiring tasks."

  description: "The future of the Internet is in the hands of the next billion users — the latest generation of internet users to come online on smartphones in places like Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Nigeria. As time goes on, the average internet user will be more like these “next billion users” than the first billion who started on PCs. That means we need to look not just at Silicon Valley or London but to places like Sao Paulo, Bangalore, Shanghai, Jakarta and Lagos to truly understand where the internet is going.<br>People in these countries are facing very different constraints to accessing the internet. In this talk, we’ll cover best practices, guidelines, and applied examples of how mobile developers can build their apps to be truly global and inclusive. Some things to consider: the next billion users have a mobile-only mindset, an instinct for ubiquitous computing, a demand for localized content; the Internet access in emerging markets is still slow and intermittent; 80% of people with disabilities live in emerging markets. Come and learn how to create great experiences that work well for billions of users around the world."
