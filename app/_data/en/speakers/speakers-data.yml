  surname: "Jurković"
  company: "Infinum"
  title: "Android Team Lead"
  bio: "I started writing web apps and websites in 2004 as a hobby. Those were simple apps written with XHTML, CSS and PHP/MySQL combo. 6 years later I decided to make a living out of my hobby so I got my first pro job in company Superius Ltd. where I've worked as a developer. A variety of everyday tasks with different technologies such as SQL Server 2005, 2008, 2008R2, PostgreSQL, PHP, Java, Android SDK expanded my knowledge and my views beyond simple and easy to implement things to large ERP and BI Systems, Mobile application development. In March 2012, I moved to another company and another city (Zagreb) in which I got a better grasp of technologies such as Java. Besides my regular work I enjoy expanding my knowledge with good books. After 2 years at Interactive1, I moved to an awesome company in Zagreb - Infinum. I improved in mobile development - Android to be exact and after 2 years here I became team lead."

  bio: "Born in Vienna, I was writing code for as long as I can think back – including for the ZX Spectrum. Just music, but hey :-) I did my bachelor degree in information and communication systems, and am working on my master degree paper in the same area. I'm a senior Java/Android developer but also spent nearly as much time in web development with PHP, SQL and JavaScript. I started Android development in 2011, and joined PSPDFKit in 2015, where I helped a lot with improving the public framework API, and invested a lot of time in creating a stable, easy-to-use and comprehensive test suite."
