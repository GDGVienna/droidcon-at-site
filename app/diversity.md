#### Diversity at droidcon Vienna

We believe into the importance of diversity. Having a broader set of people with different backgrounds at the conference will make it a better event for everybody.

Therefore we support the [Diversity Charter](http://diversitycharter.org/), initiated by [Emily Webber](http://twitter.com/ewebber).

#### Safe Environment for Everyone

We will ensure that droidcon Vienna will be a safe place for everyone. This is why we have a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), and this is why we will take the steps necessary to enforce it if necessary.
Harassment will not be tolerated. All attendees are welcomed at our event, no “jokes” of any kind around sexual orientation, gender identity, race or disabilities will have a place.

#### Diversity Tickets

As a small step towards increased diversity we are offering up to ten diversity tickets to underrepresented groups.
Women, transgender & non-binary people, people of color and disabled people are invited to apply for a diversity ticket.

Please send us a short message with why you should be part of droidcon Vienna on a diversity ticket at [team@droidcon.at](mailto:team@droidcon.at) before 1 September 2019.

#### Diverse Speakers

We strive in having a better diversity in our speaker set. To reduce unconscious bias, the talk proposals are first reviewed anonymously. The Program Committee does not know the speakers’ gender or race when rating the submissions.
In a second step we deliberately upvote speakers from diversity groups. This does not overrule good content – the best content will still be the winner – but it adds a small twist towards underrepresented groups.

#### Small Steps

These are small steps and we will continuously measure and review the situation. And if you have specific ideas how we can make droidcon Vienna even more inclusive then please let us know via [team@droidcon.at](mailto:team@droidcon.at)!
