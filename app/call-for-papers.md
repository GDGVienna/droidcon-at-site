The second call for papers is open till 10 July 2016, midnight Vienna time.

##### Topics

The theme of droidcon Vienna 2016 is *Everything Android*. We will include talks around development topics on Android, mobile app design, monetization, and related soft skills.

Among our participants are highly-skilled and experienced Android developers. Talk proposals about advanced and specialized Android topics are therefore also welcomed.

###### Type of Sessions

A regular talk (e.g. presentation, tech talk, etc) is supposed to take about 45 minutes with some minutes afterwards for questions and answers.

In addition, there is the opportunity for highlight presentations of shorter duration (20 minutes and some minutes for questions & answers). They are ideal for presenting an idea or a toolset without going too much into technical details.

###### Language of Sessions

All sessions will be held in English.

###### Equipment

Each room is equipped with a beamer and network connectivity for your notebook PC. We also have adapters for MacBook / MacBook Air (MiniDP).

###### Selection Process

To reduce unconscious bias, the talk proposals will be anonymized before being initially reviewed. In this phase the top talk proposals will be identified and shortlisted.

Afterwards we will add in the speaker details. Generally only one talk per speaker will be accepted, and we will in this second phase also review experience with past talks given.

We will contact you in case of some questions, and latest beginning of August 2016 you should hear from us whether your talk has been selected. Exceptionally high-quality talk proposals might be selected and announced even earlier.

###### Travel Subsidy

As our budget is limited we can only offer limited travel subsidy for your talk. If you need financial support please indicate so in the comment field.
